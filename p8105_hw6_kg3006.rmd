### Comparing solving crimes in males v. females in Baltimore, MD

In Balitmore, MD, the adjusted odds of a homicide being solved for Males are `r round( (baltimore_glm %>% broom::tidy(exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE) %>% filter(term == "victim_sexMale"))$estimate, 2)` (95% CI: `r round( (baltimore_glm %>% broom::tidy(exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE) %>% filter(term == "victim_sexMale"))$conf.low, 2)` - `r round( (baltimore_glm %>% broom::tidy(exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE) %>% filter(term == "victim_sexMale"))$conf.high, 2)`) times the odds for female victime, holding all other variables constant.
